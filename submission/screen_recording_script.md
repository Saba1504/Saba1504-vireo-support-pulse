# 3-minute screen-recording script

**0:00–0:25 — Start**
“Vireo asked for a simple weekly support digest and a ticket-closure leaderboard. I chose a local Streamlit tool so it runs without API keys or per-ticket model costs.”

**0:25–1:10 — Weekly digest**
“Here is a selected week. The ticket counts and category totals are deterministic from the CSV. The AI-assisted layer groups customer wording using TF-IDF and K-means, so the manager can see recurring language without reading every ticket.”

**1:10–1:45 — Leaderboard**
“The leaderboard counts resolved and closed tickets for Tier 1 agents only. I excluded Escalations & Warranty because the policy explicitly says Tier 2 is measured in days, not weekly volume.”

**1:45–2:20 — What changed**
“My first approach was to make the AI generate the whole digest. I discarded that because it makes basic counts hard to audit. The final design keeps numbers deterministic and uses ML only for unstructured-text themes.”

**2:20–2:45 — Business finding**
“The strongest measurable opportunity I found was repeat contact. The policy defines repeat contact within 30 days. My prototype uses customer, category and product as a transparent proxy and flags it for validation rather than pretending the proxy is perfect.”

**2:45–3:00 — What I threw away**
“I did not build a large platform, a per-ticket LLM pipeline, or a complex agent scoring system. The scope is intentionally small: weekly insight, auditable numbers, and a clear business case.”
